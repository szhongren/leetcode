rubric for meta behavioral interviewers

- 5 competencies
  - resolving conflict
  - driving results
  - embracing ambiguity
  - growing continuously
  - effective communication

for a senior role, meta usually looks for 2 more things:

- looks for quantitative data in answers, tie to company goals if possible
- what level did I operate at? \* this is the main thing that could get me downleveled

high level feedback

- it's important to show why the project was important, be consistent about it
- in my stories, bring in how I was leading more engineers (delegate, mentor, coordinate)
- some of answers too long
- answer the question directly and make sure to emphasize the parts that answer the question

- influence question, show that I heard others' perspective, and I brought data and convinced people with POCs/data that I brought

- some quantifications would be preferred in the situation/task and in the result
- impactful project, has to be well elaborated and more generally, including a challenge would elevate the answer
- my role was clear, but explicitly highlight what my stake was in the project (leading, mentoring, coordinating, etc)

- don't use "compromise" with Meta, frame it as an influence instead of compromise, maybe show some pushback

- understand the question behind the question, need to answer that, always answer subtextual question directly

- conflict + major impact qns, could have been better
